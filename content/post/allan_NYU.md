I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to spend a semester at the Center for Real Estate Finance Research at NYU's Stern School of Business as a visiting student under the sponsorship of Prof. Stijn van Nieuwerburgh.

#### NYU Campus
The NYU campus is beautiful. The highlight being Washington Square Park which is situated right in the middle of campus. On any given day, there's a hub of activity - live jazz, frisbee and even (quite frequently actually) marriage proposals. My personal favorite pass-time is being in the park around dusk and catching the sunset against the background of the Arch.
