      <description>I came across the Breakthrough Innovation Challenge competition via an email distributed by the career services. At the time, I was waiting for registration and first semester to begin. I convinced my friends Bridget and Wadzanai â€“ who both hold Masters in Chemical Engineering from UCT - to form a team and work to solve one of the eight challenges. They both agreed and we spent a week going through all eight challenges and in the end, each one of us had to motivate which challenge we should solve.</description>

      <description>In March, together with the Prof Doyne Farmer&amp;rsquo;s Complexity Economics team at the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the University of Oxford, we organized a workshop on the use of Agent-Based Modelling for Systemic Stress Testing. The workshop was the brainchild of Prof Farmer, a world-renowned expert in the field of Agent-Based Models and our supervisor, Co-Pierre Georg.
AIFMRM and UCT were abled to provide funding for three PhD students - myself, Esti Kemp and Tina Koziol - to attend the workshop together with Co-Pierre.</description>
